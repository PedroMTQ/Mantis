#This file is meant to be edited in your own distribution of MANTIS
#Custom hmms can be added to the "custom_hmms" folder or their absolute path can be added here
#Please add absolute paths to hmms outside of the "custom_hmms" folder


#######DEFAULT PATHS#######
#You can add custom paths here, otherwise they will be set to default values
#ncbi_dmp_path_folder=
#default_hmms_folder=
#<custom_hmms_folder> defines the folder where Mantis will look for MULTIPLE custom HMMs. Each HMM should be contained within a folder, such that the path will look something like this: /path/to/custom_hmms_folder/custom1/custom1.hmm

#####Make sure the  names of the weights correspond to the path of the hmms
#####example: <NOGT>_hmm_folder should be <NOGT>_weight
#####example: custom_hmm=path/to/customHMM.hmm should be customHMM_weight
nog_weight=0.8
pfam_weight=0.9
tigrfam_weight=0.5


#######CUSTOM HMMS#######
#<custom_hmm> defines the folder or file where Mantis will look for a SINGLE custom HMM. The path will look something like this: /path/to/custom1/custom1.hmm or /path/to/custom1/
